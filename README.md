# ReversedMinecraft

Version : 1.16.5

A medium plugin that completely mess up the game 

Here's some of the features : 

- Log and Leaves are swapped
- Some block drops and mobs drops are swapped too
- Creeper and Wolves explode when they target you (bc they can't handle the emotional shock of attacking someone)
- Evil Mobs gain speed 2 when they target you
- And a lot more WTF ideas that got out of my brain
